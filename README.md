# GovGiz

This project is quite literally just my personal site made using the GOVUK Design System and SolidJS

## Development

This project makes use of bunjs in development so I recommend using that if you do steal this site :3

To setup the development just run these commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GizzyUwU/govgiz
bun install
bun run dev
```

That's about it not really much to say for such a project.

This project is NOT affilated with the UK Government, It just makes use of there npm package govuk-frontend to make it look sigma. This project is under the MIT License so if you do copy just ensure it's allowed under the license.
