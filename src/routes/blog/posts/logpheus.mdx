Another time for a devlog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BLEH :hyper-dino-wave:
I spent most of the time improving the error handling of logpheus so it makes use of MY BUGSINK MOREEEE and its more specific with errors so now if it isnt 401 it doesnt default to no project exists at id it only does that at 404 :3c with MORE CONTEXT TOO so better easier debugging

Almost 3 hours again GOD i kinda forgor was gonna do one this morning but devlogs was done ANYWAY
- Register command and project command to register to use bot as general purpose just for its commands, user to get a persons profile and project to look at project by id ![bleh](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Femoji.slack-edge.com%2FT09V59WQY1E%2Fbleh%2F8be6dc6939de105f.png&w=30&h=30&fit=contain&n=-1) 
- Bug fixes such as shutting up the error logged when FT did a restart or anything like that ![sickbro](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Femoji.slack-edge.com%2FT09V59WQY1E%2Fsickbro%2Fdeed2ff6a3f25263.png&w=30&h=30&fit=contain&n=-1) 
- Drops disabled clients from saved clients arr because they are disabled
- More bug fixes as an FT api route changed without me knowing breaking the bot so had to fix that and fallback so if it happens again it logs to sentry as sus ![sussy](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Femoji.slack-edge.com%2FT09V59WQY1E%2Fsussy%2Fcc3a0a8a261caea2.png&w=30&h=30&fit=contain&n=-1)
- Did a update to readme to match new stuff ![yay](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Femoji.slack-edge.com%2FT09V59WQY1E%2Fyay%2F47296c029c8ee253.gif&w=30&h=30&fit=contain&n=-1)

Chat, are we codemaxxing rn? no stupid we are bugfixing dumb ahh
- Fixed my channel being spammed in dev cuz i dropped project table by adding fallback to checker to prevent that
- Fixed sentry context not being included in commands/views sending sentry errors
- I realised slack modals have private metadata and also has body so instead of manually parsing the channel and user id through view i used that to hide it from user
- Idiotproofed the bot more because people somehow keep using other self hosted instances so now titles of modals use prefix as title which is different on every self hosted instance and for offical prod its just logpheus so if you STILL use wrong instance you are dumb nothing to say more about that
- DATA COMMADN TO SEE WHAT DATA LOGPHEUS HAS ON YOU YIPEEEEEEEEEEE ![yay](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Femoji.slack-edge.com%2FT09V59WQY1E%2Fyay%2F47296c029c8ee253.gif&w=30&h=30&fit=contain&n=-1) 
- Config command not channel specific now it uses user id to update api key
- Tells user that prod exploded instead of ghostting them when it does
